              Prof. Aijing Feng,
            </a> currently working on Bioinformatics + Gen AI.

          <p>
            My research interests include multimodal models (e.g., vision, language, and speech), RL agents, and Gen AI,
            with a focus on improving inference, optimization, and scalability. I am interested in extending these models to
            cross-disciplinary domains.
          </p>

          <p>
            I’m also keen on challenges in representation learning, causal reasoning, and developing trustworthy, efficient,
            and interpretable AI systems.
          </p>

          <p>
            I’m open to research collaborations and happy to discuss potential projects. Feel free to reach out.
          </p>
